## 🚀 Key Features
- **Efficient Solving:** Utilizes a backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles quickly and accurately.
- **Console-Based Interface:** Simple and straightforward console output for easy use without the need for a graphical interface.
- **Easy to Use:** Minimal setup required—just compile and run to solve any 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.
- **Customizable Puzzles:** Easily modify the Sudoku board within the code to solve different puzzles.

## 💡 How It Works
- **Board Initialization:**
    - The application initializes a 9x9 Sudoku board with predefined values. Empty cells are represented by 0.
- **Backtracking Algorithm:**
    - The solver scans the board to find empty cells.
    - For each empty cell, it tries numbers from 1 to 9.
    - It checks if placing a number violates Sudoku rules (no duplicates in the current row, column, or 3x3 subgrid).
    - If a valid number is found, it places the number and recursively attempts to solve the rest of the board.
    - If no valid number is found, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries the next number.
- **Solution Output:**
    - Once the board is successfully solved, the application prints the solved Sudoku board to the console.
    - If the board is unsolvable, it notifies the user accordingly.

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies Used
- **Java:** A versatile and widely-used programming language, ideal for building robust applications.
- **IDE (Optional):** Integrated Development Environment for writing and debugging Java code.
- **Git:** Version control system for tracking changes and collaborating on the project.
